##### US Bikeshare project for Data Science Nanodegree Program
## Overview:
The project requires us to do a data analysis for 3 major cities which are: Chicago, New York City, and Washington who have a
bike stations.
* The data is raw data where it needs to be filtered and analyzed
* The task is to create an interactive program using python as the main programing language

## Files needed to complete the project:
* bikeshre_2.py
* Chicago.csv
* New_york_city.csv
* Washington.csv

## Soruces used to help me finish the project:
* 1) I had an issue with a message Non-ASCII character '\xe2' when I run the program, I solved it looking at this solution:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25190659/syntaxerror-non-ascii-character-xe2/25191228

* 2) I used the following link to figure out the issue of combining two or more columns using panads:

* 3) Used the following link to know exactly how to put an input function:

## Software needed to run the project:
* python
* Text editor i.e atom

## How to use the program and what it does:
# How to use the program:
* You can use a command line to run the program, for example if you are using mac, then:
Python3 python.py
This code will run the program.
* Then a message will appear to make you choose which city do you want to have data about, after you select the city, then,
* you will be asked to provide the time first a month of your choice then a day of your choice
* Then you can see all the data for that city
# What the code does:
* The code will run on the background to gather and analyze all the requirements you have provided on the previous step.

## The statistics required to compute on the project:
Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time):

most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day
Popular stations and trip:

most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
Trip duration:

total travel time
average travel time
User info:

counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
